# Notes-1-Cloud-Concepts
## A Brief History
- Computing in the "cloud" traces back to the Origins of utility computing
- Computer Scientist John McCarthy Proposed this in 1961
  - ***compuiting may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telphone system is a public utility -John McCarthy***
- In 1969 Leonard Kleinrock, a chief scientist of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or ARPANET project that seeded the Internet, stated:
  -  ***As of now, computer networks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of 'computer utilities***
 - In the Mid 1990's the general Public have been using internet-based utilities computer utilities through various incarnations of search engines / e-mail services / open publishing platforms
- SalesForce.com pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisioned services into the enterprise
- Amazon.com launched the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, a suite of enterprise-oriented services. Provided remotely privionsed storage, computing resources, and business functionality 
- Cloud computing emerged in the commerical arena in 2006, when amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services that enabled organizations to "lease" computing capacity and processing power to run their enterprise applications. Google Apps also began providing browser-based enterprise applications in the same year, and three years later, the Google App Engine became another historic milestone.

## Definitions 
- " **Scalable** and **Elastic** - Gartner "
- " Standardized IT capability (services, software, or infrastructure) delievered via internet technologies in a pay-per-use, self-service way. - Forrester Research "
- Convineniet on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( netowrks,servers,storage,applications, and services)
- ***Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.*** - Forrestor Research

## Business Drivers 
- Business Drivers  motivated organizations to adopt cloud computing in support of their business automation requirements.
- Correspondingly motivated otehr oganizations to become provides of cloud enviornments and cloud technology vendors in order to create and emet eh demand to fulfill consumer needs

## Capacity Planning
- capacity planning is the process of determining and fulfilling fuutre demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services, Within this context, capacity represents the maxiumum amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time. 
- Capacity planning is focused on minimizing this discrepancy to achieve predictable efficiency and performance.
  -Different capicity planning strategies exist: 
    - ***Lead Strategy*** - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
    - ***Lag Strategy*** - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
    - ***Match Strategy*** - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases
    
## Cost Reduction
- Direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain. Growth of IT enviornemnts often corresponds to the assessment of their maximum usage requirements. Its An ever-increasing investment.
- Two costs need to be accounted for:
  1. The cost of acquiring new infrastructure
  2. THe cost of its ongoing Ownership
- Operational overhead represents a condsiderable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up=front investment costs.

-Common Forms of infrastructure-related
